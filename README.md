6. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Blockchain Integration

The application uses Ethereum blockchain for backend operations. It interacts with two smart contracts: `cinemaContract` and `ticketContract`. The addresses of these contracts are stored in `contractAddress.json`.

## Store

The application uses Redux for state management. The `store` directory contains the actions and states for global management.

## Utils

The `utils` directory contains fake data, helper functions, and type definitions used across the application.

## Smart Contracts

The `contracts` directory contains the Solidity smart contracts that power the blockchain functionality of the Fullstack NFT Cinemas System.

### DappCinemas.sol

This is the main contract that handles the core functionalities of the cinema system.

### DappTickets.sol

This is the sub contract that handles the responsibility of managing tickets as NFTs.

### Base64.sol

This is a utility contract that provides a function for encoding some bytes in base64.

### DappShared.sol

This contract provides shared data and functions that are used in other contracts.
